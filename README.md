# The Roell Lab Website
The Roell lab at University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa aims to advance the process of industrial fermentation. The computational tools we develop help the field of synthetic biology to realize its full potential.

Our lab is looking for students at all levels (undergraduates, masters, and Ph.D. students). If you are interested in conducting research at the intersection of synthetic biology and AI, please contact Garrett Roell directly at [groell@hawaii.edu](groell@hawaii.edu).
